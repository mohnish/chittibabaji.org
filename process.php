 <p>There seems to be a universal mystic way, the actual process by which the mystic arrives at union with the absolute identified by five stages of this process. First is the awakening, the stage in which one begins to have some consciousness of absolute or divine reality. The second stage is one of purgation which is characterized by an awareness of one's own imperfections and finiteness. The response in this stage is one of self-discipline and mortification.<img src="_images/process.jpg" align="right" /> The third stage, illumination, is one reached by artists and visionaries as well as being the final stage of some mystics. It is marked by a consciousness of a transcendent order and a vision of a new heaven and a new earth. The great mystics go beyond the stage of illumination to another stage that seems to have seven different stages or the Sapta Bhumika. There seems to be a great lot of similarity between this and the Mahayana Buddhist notion of Dasabhumi, which incidentally was propounded in Early Andhra. The stages are final and complete purification and are marked by confusion, helplessness, stagnation of the will, and a sense of the withdrawal of Nature's presence. It is the period of final "unselfing" and the surrender to the hidden purposes of the divine will. The final and last stage is one of union with the object of love, the one Reality, Nature manifested in a godhead or in many cases it many be manifested in a Formless and Content less Void called Sunya by the Buddhists.Here the self has been permanently established on a transcendental level and liberated for a new purpose. Filled up with Nature, it immerses itself in the temporal order, the world of appearances in order to incarnate the eternal in time, to become the mediator between time and eternity.	     </p>
	   <p> Theoretically, the process can generally be described as above but in the mundane realm individuals encounter an ever increasing labyrinth through which nothing can be drawn conclusively. Chittibaba and Babu have repeatedly stressed the need for simplifying the labyrinthine process by recognising daily life to be the basic grid of spiritual experience verifiable by virtues such as dedication towards everything that is energised by the very definition of life. The seer/mystic is therefore a living example of the perfection that symbolises divinity. Babu in his interaction with hundreds of people on an every day basis dwells extensively on the mundane aspects of each person which in a conscious way changes him/her to enable them to perfect the skill of living, which is nothing but the zenith of spirituality. </p>
