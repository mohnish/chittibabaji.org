    <div class="post-content">
      <p>There arenâ€™t any two ways of knowing mysticism. But to comprehend it in a rational manner and in order to find its origin we need to divide mysticism into having at least two distinctive features. One that directly teaches us a way of looking at the world which is mystical in itself and the other which strives to look at mysticism objectively as a concept that has had an evolutionary process. However, the extent to which we can rationalise the mystical process can only be limited to the singular purpose of establishing a certain coherence, since mysticism is essentially unlearning all rationale.</p>

<p>Mysticism can be defined as a world-view that situates man as a small strand in an immense web of magic. The web can also be signified as Nature, in its original, pristine form. Each person again is viewed as a unique component converging to a collective, which in turn is a minuscule part of nature.</p>

<p>Mysticism (from the Greek mystikos, an initiate of the Eleusinian Mysteries; mysteria meaning &ldquo;initiation&rdquo;) is the pursuit of achieving communion, identity with, or conscious awareness of ultimate reality, the divinity, spiritual truth, or God through direct experience, intuition, or insight. Traditions may include a belief in the literal existence of dimensional realities beyond empirical perception, or a belief that a true human perception of the world goes beyond current logical reasoning or intellectual comprehension. A person delving in these areas may be called a Mystic. In many cases, the purpose of mysticism and mystical disciplines is to reach a state of return or re-integration with Nature, that is perceived through a anthropomorphic god or ritual. A common theme in mysticism is that the mystic and all of reality are One. The purpose of mystical practices is to achieve that oneness in experience, to achieve a larger identity and re-identify with the all that is. The state of oneness has many names depending on the mystical system.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;mysticism&rdquo; is often used to refer to beliefs which go beyond the purely exoteric practices of mainstream religions, while still being related to or based in a mainstream religious doctrine. For example, Kabbalah is a significant mystical movement within Judaism, and Sufism is a significant mystical movement within Islam. Gnosticism refers to various mystical sects of classical / late antiquity that were influenced by Platonism, Judaism and Christianity. Some have argued that early Christianity itself was a mystical sect that arose out of Judaism. Non-traditional knowledge and ritual are considered as Esotericism, for example Buddhism&rsquo;s Vajrayana. Vedanta, the Naths (North India), the Datta (South India), Siddha, Nagas are considered the several mystical branches of Indic religions, being a system of ancient religions and a rather broad &lsquo;all-paths&rsquo; embracing philosophy, has many mystical branches, Saiva, Bhagavata, Sakteya and Saurya religions.</p>

<p>Mystical doctrines may reference religious texts that are non-canonical, as well as more mainstream canon, and generally require a more committed intellectual, psychological and physical approach from spiritual devotees. Most mystical teachers typically have some history or connection with a mainstream religious branch &ndash; controversial or otherwise, but gather followers through reinterpreting sacred texts or developing new spiritual approaches from their own unique experience</p>
