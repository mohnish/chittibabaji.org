    <div class="post-title">Welcome to Sadguru Chittibabji</div>
    <div class="post-content">
      <p>The greatest revelation of mankind has been to those who have discovered themselves to be part of nature. A realisation that leads one towards the mysterious unknown and the unobvious.</p>

<p>What is it? How does one get to know it? Fact remains that we can only infer and speculate. We remain, the clueless. Wanderers, stuck to the notion of a path. But truth it seems is a pathless land. All those who are part of the supreme revelation in all ages, times and conditions are the mystics. Chittibaba was a mystic. This is about him.</p>
