The greatest revelation of mankind has been to those who have discovered themselves to be part of nature. A realisation that leads one towards the mysterious unknown and the unobvious.

What is it? How does one get to know it? Fact remains that we can only infer and speculate. We remain, the clueless. Wanderers, stuck to the notion of a path. But truth it seems is a pathless land. All those who are part of the supreme revelation in all ages, times and conditions are the mystics. Chittibaba was a mystic. This is about him.
