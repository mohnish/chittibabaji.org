        The greatest revelation of mankind has been to those who have discovered themselves to be part of nature. A realisation that leads one towards the mysterious unknown and the unobvious. </p>
        
       <p> What is it? How does one get to know it? Fact remains that we can only infer speculate. We remain, the clueless. Wanderers, stuck to the notion of a path. But truth it seems is a pathless land. All those who are part of the supreme revelation in all ages, times and conditions are the mystics. Chittibaba was a mystic. This is about him.      </p>
