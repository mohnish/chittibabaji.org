            <td width="511" height="669" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="login">Mystics hold that there is a deeper, more fundamental state of existence  hidden beneath the appearances of day to day living (which may become, to the  mystic, superficial or epiphenomenal). For the authentic mystic, unity is both  the internal and external focus as one seeks the truth about oneself, one&rsquo;s  relationship to others and reality (both the world at large and the unseen  realm). The mystic&rsquo;s motivation for such an arduous endeavour appears to be  unique to the individual and culture, and sometimes a new religion, order or  sect may be the legacy. Generally approached through the purification processes  of prayer, meditation, contemplation (communion with Reality) and a wide  variety of other means, the mystic seeks to transcend any constraint to his  direct experience of the divine.<br />
              <br />
              The divine realm has been expressed in any of various ways across cultures -  as God/Allah/Brahma/Creator, Baqa' (Sufism), the perfect goodness, ultimate  reality, Hal (Persian Sufism), a universal presence, force or divine principle.  The ultimate unification with the divine may be experienced by the mystic as  psychological emancipation, Samadhi, being born again, Wahdat al-Wujud (Sufism)  or unity consciousness, but in practical terms it can be described as a  surrendered egoless state in which the external world synchronizes with the  mystic's true nature and purpose. The term, heaven/nirvana, while generally  considered an after-death experience in Islam, Judaism, Christianity and Indic  religions including Buddhism is understood by the mystic as a non-physical  realm or &quot;field&quot; with physical effects in the eternal  &quot;now.&quot; Severe cultural alienation often accompanies this effort as  the mystic turns away from the world either through fasting or emptying,  seeking reunion with the God-head within.<br />
              <br />
              Mysticism is usually understood in a religious context, but as Chittibaba  and Babu have pointed out, transcendent experiences may happen to anyone,  regardless of religious training or inclinations. Such experiences can occur  unbidden and without preparation at any time, and might not be understood as  religious experiences at all. A momentary unity may be experienced by the  artist or athlete as a perceived interconnection with existence or a loss of  self accompanied by feelings of euphoria, by the scientist as a spontaneous  ecstatic inspiration, by an ordinary individual as a shift in physical reality  after experiencing a temporary uncomplicated state of mind, by a prophet as an  open channel of knowledge or even dismissed as psychological disturbances in  modern times.<br />
              <br />
              But, the authentic mystic's ultimate goal is a sustained stable state of  full consciousness, wholeness/holiness through self-knowledge. First, the  observer role must be stabilized before he/she can return to being, merge with  the pre-existent field - the Divine, allowing him to fulfil his purpose or  realize his passion. With that in mind, the word mysticism is best used to  point to conscious and systematic attempts to gain transcendent  insights/experiences through studies and practice. Possible techniques include  meditation, contemplation (of causality), prayer, asceticism (fasting from the  world), devotions, Dhikr, Sama, the chanting of mantras or holy names,  communion with entheogens, and intellectual investigation. Mystics typically go  beyond specific religious perspectives or dogmas in their teachings, espousing  an inclusive and universal perspective that rises above traditional sectarian  differences because they comprehend the shared basis of other religious  traditions beneath the superficial. <br />
              <br />
              Chittibaba points out that a mystical experience displays the world through  a different lens than ordinary experience. The experience, in his words, is  &quot;ineffable&quot; and &quot;poetic&quot;; placed beyond the descriptive  abilities of language. While there is debate over what this implies, and  whether the experience actually transcends the phenomenal or material world of  ordinary perception, or rather transcends the capacities of ordinary perception  to bring the phenomenal and material world into full view, it should be  remembered that a complete absence of terminology - related to modern  psychology, biology and physics - existed during the evolution of mankind's  sacred texts and earliest attempts to communicate the unity experience. Ancient  religious and mystical language may become more accessible with modern  terminology and understanding in future translations and interpretations.  However, mystics generally focus on the experience itself, and rarely concern  themselves with ontological discussions assuming that the initiate understands,  or will grasp the semantics as they progress<br />
